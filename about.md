I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Knowledge Integration](https://uwaterloo.ca/knowledge-integration/node/1) and the [Department of Sociology and Legal Studies](https://uwaterloo.ca/sociology-and-legal-studies/) at University of Waterloo. My PhD is in sociology from McMaster University. 

Broadly, my research and teaching interests are in the sociologies of knowledge and science, technology, social network analysis, comparative cultural sociology, and environmental sociology. I am interested in collaborating with or supervising students in any of these areas.

My current research, funded by SSHRC, examines collaborative relationships in large on-line networks of open source developers. My other research projects address knowledge production and promotion in think tanks, the structure of intellectual fields and networks, and struggles over expertise about climate change in the public sphere.
