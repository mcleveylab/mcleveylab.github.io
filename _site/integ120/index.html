<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>This course introduces students to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/knowledge-integration/node/1">Knowledge Integration</a>, with a particular focus on the organization of information and knowledge. More specifically, it focuses on how information and expert knowledge are shaped by social networks, information communication technologies, disciplines, and interdisciplinary fields. We will also cover analytic skills that are useful in all types of knowledge work (e.g. managing research collections), and start developing effective research and writing habits. </p>

<p>Please note that this course emphasizes collaborative learning. Group discussions will usually take place at the beginning of the class, followed by any lecture material at the end. When I lecture, it will mostly be to explain difficult concepts or aspects of the readings that are not addressed in group discussion. Finally, most of the writing you do will be shared with the class using the team collaboration tool <a href="https://slack.com">#slack</a>. </p>

<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>By the end of this course, you should be able to: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand and Apply Course Material 
    <ul>
      <li>Explain how social networks shape information flows, learning, and collective action</li>
      <li>Describe how “the new media and information ecology” does and does not affect disciplinary and interdisciplinary expert knowledge</li>
      <li>Characterize the limitations of common-sense thinking for complex problems in the social sciences and humanities </li>
      <li>Define and explain the importance of “network literacy”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Develop Research and Writing Skills 
    <ul>
      <li>Learn fundamental rules of composition</li>
      <li>Manage research collections using <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a></li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assignments--evaluation">Assignments &amp; Evaluation</h2>

<p>Given the learning objectives outlined above, your grade in this course will be based on the tasks in Table 1, and described below.</p>

<p>To do well in this course, you have to take the material seriously, consider it, and discuss it. If you have strongly held opinions, you should be willing to change your mind on the basis of empirical evidence, or rational and respectful argument. That said, you do not have to agree with the readings, with what I say about them, or what others say about them. When you disagree, <strong>be respectful</strong>.  </p>

<h3 id="reading-memos-5--5--5">Reading Memos (5% + 5% + 5%)</h3>

<p>You will submit 3 reading memos throughout the semester. You will write a memo on a reading of your choice from weeks 1-5, from weeks 8-9, and from weeks 6-7 <em>or</em> weeks 10-11. Each memo should be roughly 300 words, and should not exceed 330 words. I expect them to be thoughtful, clear, and carefully edited. Your reading memos should identify core points from the readings, offer any thoughts or reactions, and raise possible questions. You are encouraged but not required to relate them to any personal experiences. </p>

<p>Each memo is due <em>the night before</em> the class where will will discuss the readings you wrote about. <strong>These memos will be shared with the class on  <a href="https://slack.com">#slack</a></strong>, where others can read and leave <em>constructive and thoughtful</em> comments. You are not required to comment on the memos, but doing so is a good way to contribute to class discussions. Disrespectful comments will not be tolerated. They will be as damaging to your participation grade as hostile behaviour in the classroom.</p>

<p>I will grade your reading memos using the following check-minus to check-plus-plus system: </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Check-Minus</strong>: The memo does not engage with the reading, or engages it in a superficial or erroneous way (<em>roughly 0-2/5 or less</em>)  </li>
  <li><strong>Check</strong>: The memo reflects on, or poses thoughtful questions about, the reading, and the writing is acceptable (<em>roughly 3/5 or less</em>)  </li>
  <li><strong>Check-Plus</strong>: The memo is very insightful, carefully thought through, and well written (<em>roughly 4/5 or less</em>)  </li>
  <li><strong>Check-Plus-Plus</strong>: The memo far exceeds my expectations and is very well written (<em>roughly 5/5</em>)  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible to get a check if the ideas in the memo are good but the writing is rough, but you may receive a check-minus if the writing is very poor. Good writing alone will not guarantee that you will get a check-plus or a check-plus-plus. </p>

<h3 id="time-diaries-with-personal-reflection-20--20">Time Diaries with Personal Reflection (20% + 20%)</h3>

<p>You will write two time diary entries on themes from the readings that I announce in class. Following the actual time diary content, you should include a personal reflection that engages class material.  Each entry should be roughly 600 words, and should not exceed 650 words. Examples of these time diaries can be found in the “Interlude” sections of the Rainee and Wellman book <em>Networked</em>.</p>

<p>Like the reading memos, your time diary entries will be <strong>shared on <a href="https://slack.com">#slack</a></strong> for the class to read and leave thoughtful comments on.</p>

<h3 id="analytic-paper-on-the-future-of-networked-individualism-30">Analytic Paper on “The Future of Networked Individualism” (30%)</h3>

<p>You will write one analytic paper that responds to ideas from “The Future of Networked Individualism” in Rainee and Wellman’s book <em>Networked</em>. The paper should be roughly 1,500 words and should <em>not</em> exceed 1,600 words. I will provide more details about this paper in class. </p>

<p>Your papers will also be shared on  <a href="https://slack.com">#slack</a> for people to read and leave comments on.</p>

<h3 id="participation--engagement-and-attendance-12--3">Participation / Engagement and Attendance (12% + 3%)</h3>

<p>The quality of this course — like any other — depends on you being engaged. Your participation grade will be based on (a) contributions to class discussion, (b) small group discussion, (c) comments left on the course blog, and (d) attendance. If you <em>really</em> don’t like speaking up in class, you can participate more on the course blog.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Although I will not be assigning a participation grade until the end of the semester, I am happy to provide qualitative feedback on your participation throughout the semester. </p>

<!-- Our Liaison Librarian from the Dana Porter Library will be giving a library workshop in class during regular class hours on **date**. The workshop will introduce important databases, and will cover how to use the library system to find books and articles. This includes instruction on how to use subject indexes and perform Boolean searches for better results. -->

<!-- Throughout the semester, we will hold impromptu "skill sessions," including on concept mapping, outlining, collaborating with  [#slack](https://slack.com), and managing research collections in  [](http://www.zotero.org/}{Zotero}. Many of these sessions will be covered towards the end of the course (weeks 9-12) -->

<h2 id="the-writing-centre">The Writing Centre</h2>

<p>Although I will be giving you feedback on your work throughout the term, I encourage you to make appointments with people at  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-centre/i-need-writing-help/writing-tutorial">the writing centre</a>. Their services are available to all UW students.</p>

<!-- ## Workshops and Skill Sessions -->

<!-- Our Liaison Librarian from the Dana Porter Library --- Sarah Brown --- will be giving a library workshop during one of our September classes. The exact date will be announced in class, but it will be held in RCH 207 during regular class hours. The workshop will introduce the libraries most important databases, and will cover how to use the library system to books and articles. This includes instruction on how to perform Boolean searches for better results.   -->

<!-- Throughout the semester, we will hold impromptu "skill sessions" on concept and mind mapping, citation styles, managing research collections in  [](http://www.zotero.org/}{Zotero}, and outlining for academic writing. As previously noted, your involvement in these sessions is part of your participation / engagement grade.   -->

<!-- Towards the end of the semester, we will have two skill sessions on  [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart}{Gantt charts}. Among other things, Gantt charts can help you systematically plan your education. In one session, you will use class time to begin developing a Gantt chart of your University of Waterloo degree. Hopefully, you will revise the project file over the years as you work on your degree. *Your work in these sessions is part of your participation / engagement grade, not work on an assignment that you will submit for marks.* -->

<h2 id="submitting-work">Submitting Work</h2>

<p>You will submit all work electronically on  <a href="https://slack.com">#slack</a>. Please do not give me hard copies of anything, under any circumstances. </p>

<h2 id="access-ability-services">Access Ability Services</h2>

<p>The  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/disability-services/">AccessAbility Office</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with the AccessAbility Office at the beginning of each academic term.  </p>

<h2 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h2>

<p>The University of Waterloo, the Faculty of Environment, and our Departments consider students’ well-being to be extremely important. We recognize that throughout the term students may face health challenges — physical and / or emotional.  Please note that help is available. Mental health is a serious issue for everyone and can affect your ability to do your best work. Counselling Services<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> is an inclusive, non-judgmental, and confidential space for anyone to seek support. They offer confidential counselling for a variety of areas including anxiety, stress management, depression, grief, substance use, sexuality, relationship issues, and much more. </p>

<h2 id="university-policies">University Policies</h2>

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>We will all uphold academic integrity policies at University of Waterloo, which include but are not limited to  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/about-academic-integrity/integrity-policies-0">promoting academic freedom and a community free from discrimination and harassment</a>. You can educate yourself on these policies — and the disciplinary processes in place to deal with violations — on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/integrity-waterloo-students">Office of Academic Integrity website</a>.</p>

<p>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offense, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offense, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work / collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor, academic advisor, or the Undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student Discipline.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> For typical penalties, check Guidelines for Assessment of Penalties.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="grievances-and-appeals">Grievances and Appeals</h3>

<p>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of his / her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy 70 — Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> When in doubt please contact your Undergraduate Advisor for details.</p>

<p>A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70 — Student Petitions and Grievances (other than a petition) or Policy 71 — (Student Discipline) may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to Policy 72 (Student Appeals)<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="religious-observances">Religious Observances</h3>

<p>Student needs to inform the instructor <strong>at the beginning of term</strong> if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and assignments. </p>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>

<p>I will use LEARN’s Survey tool to solicit brief and informal course evaluations three or four times throughout the semester. These are <em>anonymous</em>, and will only take a few minutes of your time. The purpose is to make sure that we are moving at a comfortable pace, that you feel you understand the material, and that my teaching style is meeting your needs. I will use this ongoing feedback to make adjustments as the course progresses. Although you are not obligated to do so, please fill out the evaluations so that I can make this the best learning experience for you, and the best teaching experience for me.</p>

<h2 id="class-schedule-and-assigned-readings">Class Schedule and Assigned Readings</h2>

<p>Please note that we may adjust the reading schedule throughout the semester. Changes will be announced in class and via the course website on LEARN. </p>
