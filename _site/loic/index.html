<p>This letter is an invitation to participate in research on the culture and organization of F/OSS software development. You are invited to participate in an <em>imitation game</em>, which is an experiment designed to help us understand what it is like to be involved in open source development. The experiment consists of three people – you and two others. In the experiment, one person acts as the judge and asks questions; the other, like you, answers these questions. The difference between the two people answering the questions is that one is an open source developer and the other is not. The aim of the experiment is to see if the judge can identify which person is the open source developer just by the answers they give to the questions the judge asks.<sup id="fnref:harry"><a href="#fn:harry" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In order for the experiment to work properly it is important that you answer all questions honestly and accurately and do not confer with or assist the other participants in any way. In addition, please do not try to fool the judge in any way or to speak for “people in general.” Just answer “as yourself.”</p>

<p>I will not use your name or other identifying information in any publications or other research products. If I quote you or anyone else participating in the experiment, I will remove identifying information and use a pseudonym. You should keep in mind, however, that people you know may be able to identify you by the experiences or events you describe. Data will be stored in digital form only, on an encrypted disk image on a password protected laptop. Because this experiment is taking place via email, the exchanges will also be stored on the email servers. </p>

<p>Your participation in this research is voluntary. There are no anticipated risks of involvement. If you decide to participate, you are free to decline to answer any questions, end your involvement in the experiment, or withdraw at any time, even after signing the consent form. If you decide to withdraw, there will be no consequences to you. In cases of withdrawal, any data you have provided will be destroyed unless you request otherwise.  </p>

<p>When I am ready to publish results from this research, I will prepare summaries of key findings for my participants. You will have the opportunity in the consent form to indicate if you would like to receive a copy. I will also make any publications available to you upon request. </p>

<p>If you have questions or would like more information about the study, please contact me by email at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#106;&#111;&#104;&#110;&#046;&#109;&#099;&#108;&#101;&#118;&#101;&#121;&#064;&#117;&#119;&#097;&#116;&#101;&#114;&#108;&#111;&#111;&#046;&#099;&#097;">&#106;&#111;&#104;&#110;&#046;&#109;&#099;&#108;&#101;&#118;&#101;&#121;&#064;&#117;&#119;&#097;&#116;&#101;&#114;&#108;&#111;&#111;&#046;&#099;&#097;</a>, or phone at (519) 888-4567 ext. 31938.
