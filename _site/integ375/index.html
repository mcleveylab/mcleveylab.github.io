<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>This course is about (<em>i.</em>) the production of science and technology in specific contexts, and (<em>ii.</em>) struggles over scientific expertise and technology in the public sphere. Topics we will examine include the role of culture and organizations in knowledge creation, gender inequalities, expert advising and governance, science and social movements, the cultures of hacking, and the causes of “normal accidents” involving high-risk technology. The course has a strong collaborative learning component, and will include a lot of discussion. </p>

<h1 id="assignments--evaluation">Assignments &amp; Evaluation</h1>

<p>To do well in this course, you have to take the material seriously, consider it, and discuss it. You should be willing to change your mind on the basis of rational and respectful argument, but you do not have to agree with the readings, with what I say about them, or what others say about them. When you disagree, <em>be respectful</em>.</p>

<p>Given the learning objectives outlined above, your grade in this course will be based on: </p>

<h3 id="memos-posted-to-the-course-blog-30">3 Memos Posted to the Course Blog (30%)</h3>

<p>We have a course blog (hosted on LEARN) that you will be expected to contribute to at least 3 times.<sup id="fnref:part"><a href="#fn:part" class="footnote">2</a></sup> You will sign up for specific readings to write about in our first class meeting. I will be grading these before every class, so they <strong>must</strong> be posted before the beginning of class. </p>

<p>Your memos should be about 500 words. <strong>I will stop reading after 800 words.</strong> I expect them to be thoughtful, clear, and carefully edited. They should identify core points from the readings, offer any thoughts or reactions, and raise possible questions. You are encouraged but not required to relate them to any personal experiences. </p>

<p>Each memo is due <em>before</em> the class begins, and will be graded as:  </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Check-minus</strong>: means the memo does not engage with the assigned reading, or engages the reading in a very superficial or erroneous way (<em>roughly 7/10 or less</em>)</li>
  <li><strong>Check</strong>: means the memo reflects on or poses thoughtful questions about the reading, and the writing is acceptable (<em>roughly 8/10 or less</em>)</li>
  <li><strong>Check-plus</strong>: means that the memo is very insightful, carefully thought through, and well written (<em>roughly 9/10 or less</em>)</li>
  <li><strong>Check-plus-plus</strong>: means that the memo far exceeds my expectations and is very well written (<em>roughly 10/10</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible to get a check if the memo is good but the writing is rough, but you may receive a check-minus if the writing is very poor. Good writing alone will not guarantee that you will get a check-plus or a check-plus-plus. Please see the section below on academic integrity. </p>

<p>Blog comments are part of your participation grade, <strong>so you should read the memos and post at least one comment every week.</strong> If you don’t like speaking up, this is one way to work on your participant / engagement grade. Disrespectful comments will not be tolerated. They will be as damaging to your participation grade as hostile behaviour in the classroom.</p>

<h3 id="collaborative-empirical-research-on-scholarly-networks-20">Collaborative Empirical Research on Scholarly Networks (20%)</h3>

<p>Much of the research on science and technology requires understanding – and being able to think in terms of – networks. To help you learn how to do this, you will do your own empirical research on scholarly networks. You do not need to have a background in network analysis, quantitative sociology, statistics, mathematics, or programming in order to do the research for this class. If you tend to think in more qualitative or historical-comparative ways, you should know that there is a long and important tradition of qualitative social network analysis.  </p>

<!-- Keep in mind that this is not a course *on* network analysis. Although you will learn many important concepts and some basic skills, there are many important things we will not cover that would be found in a course primarily about social network analysis. -->

<p>60% of your final grade is set aside for your research on scholarly networks (including the analysis, writing, and presentation). You will work on the analysis throughout the semester during the Friday workshops (see the schedule below). In groups of 2-3, you will (1) choose a scholarly area or journal and collect publication data from the Web of Science database, (2) prepare the data and do basic analysis using <a href="https://sci2.cns.iu.edu/user/index.php">Sci2</a>, and (3) visualize and analyze the networks using <a href="https://gephi.org">Gephi</a>.<sup id="fnref:igraph"><a href="#fn:igraph" class="footnote">3</a></sup> I will teach you how to do all of this in class. <em>Together, we will develop group contracts and expectations documents that will set the context for your collaborations.</em></p>

<p>You are free to choose the scholarly area / community that you want to explore in consultation with me. For example, you might look at the intellectual communities around journals that publish research in the sociology of science / science and technology studies (e.g. <em>Social Studies of Science</em>; <em>Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values</em>; or <em>Scientometrics</em>), the history and / or philosophy of science (<em>Synthese</em> or <em>Isis</em>), or information science (e.g. <em>The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science</em>, or <em>Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</em>).<sup id="fnref:prevstu"><a href="#fn:prevstu" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>We will being using <a href="https://sci2.cns.iu.edu/user/index.php">Sci2</a> and <a href="https://gephi.org">Gephi</a> to analyze scholarly networks. All three are open source and can be downloaded free of cost. <strong>Please download them before class on February 7.</strong> I will remind you throughout the semester.</p>

<!-- # Assignment on public debates about science / technology -->

<!-- Parts of this course address contentious debates about the regulation of science and technology, and the role of science in governance. To further your understanding of these issues, 50% of your final grade (including the analysis, writing, and presentation) is set aside for an empirical analysis of a specific debate about science or technology. This means that \emph{you} will directly examine a debate using textual data that \emph{you} collect and analyze yourself. You should choose an issue we cover in class, but if there is something specific you want to do that is not covered, let me know. -->

<!-- In the process of learning about the specific issues, you will also (1) deepen your understanding of how public debates "work," and (2) get introduced to methods of content and textual analysis. -->

<!-- You will break into groups with shared interests in a particular issue. Together, you will (1) define your interests, (2) collect textual data from newspapers, blogs, or magazines using the LexisNexis or Factiva databases,^[ Both are available through the library website. I will teach you how to use them.] and (3) prepare the data for qualitative or quantitative analyses. (4) In addition to performing some basic analysis as a group, you should support one another as you work on more specialized analyses of the data for your research papers (described below).  -->

<!-- Based on discussion in class and your own reading, you can choose a method of content or textual analysis that you feel is best suited to your questions and your data. You may use either qualitative or quantitative methods.  -->

<p>We will set aside class time throughout the semester to work on your projects, discuss methodology, and address practical matters pertaining to content and text analysis.</p>

<h3 id="presentation-5">Presentation (5%)</h3>

<p>At the end of the semester, we will use some class time for you to present and discuss your research. These presentations are meant to be informal conversations about what you learned, but you <em>should</em> be prepared. All collaborators should say something about the research. </p>

<h3 id="co-authored-research-paper-35">Co-Authored Research Paper (35%)</h3>

<p>Your papers will present your research on scholarly networks, which means that your co-authors will be the same people you collaborated on the analysis with. Undergraduate students rarely co-author papers in university, but co-authoring is <em>very</em> common in most academic disciplines and in the public, private, and non-profit sectors. We will discuss co-authoring in detail throughout the semester, including how to avoid violating academic integrity policies. <em>Together, we will develop group contracts and expectations documents that will set the context for your collaborations.</em></p>

<p>Your paper should be roughly 10 single space pages (approx. 5,000 words) before references, have standard margins, and use a 12 pt font.<sup id="fnref:spacing"><a href="#fn:spacing" class="footnote">5</a></sup> Roughly 5-6 pages (approx. 2,000 – 3,000 words) of the paper should be set aside for a formal presentation of the results (including a visualization of the network), and a bigger picture discussion. Do not use a cover page. Put the title and your names <strong>in alphabetical order</strong> at the top of the first page. You are free to use any citation style you like, but you must use it consistently.</p>

<p>You cannot submit the same work more than once. Although you may use some ideas that were raised in a memo on the blog, you can not directly copy text from your memo and use it in your research paper. If you are uncertain about whether or not you can use some text from a memo that you wrote, please consult me. </p>

<p>You will submit your research papers to a dropbox on LEARN, which will be set up with the plagiarism detector <strong>Turn It In.</strong> If you don’t want to submit your research paper to Turn It In, you can schedule a 30-40 minute meeting to discuss your paper with me in detail.</p>

<p>I will discuss my grading criteria in more detail in our class meetings, and I am happy to discuss your work in progress or when it is finished. If you feel you have been given a grade you don’t deserve, please wait 24 hours and then write a 500-600 word memo to me outlining the perceived error.</p>

<p>Although I will be giving you feedback on your work throughout the term, I encourage you to make appointments with people at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-centre/i-need-writing-help/writing-tutorial">the writing centre</a>. Their services are available to all UW students.</p>

<h3 id="participation-10">Participation (10%)</h3>

<p>The quality of this course – like any other – depends on you being engaged. Your participation grade will be based on (a) contributions to class discussion, (b) small group discussion, (c) comments left on the course blog, and (d) attendance. If you <strong>really</strong> don’t like speaking up in class, you can participate more on the course blog.<sup id="fnref:part:1"><a href="#fn:part" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Although I will not be assigning a participation grade until the end of the semester, I am happy to provide qualitative feedback on your participation throughout the semester. </p>

<h1 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h1>

<p>This is a seminar, so your attendance makes a <strong>big</strong> difference. You are permitted to miss class twice throughout the semester without a medical note. For each additional class you miss without a medical note, I will take 1% off your participation grade. Consistent lateness will also negatively influence your participation grade.</p>

<h1 id="submitting-work">Submitting Work</h1>

<p>You will submit <strong>all</strong> work electronically. Please submit PDFs <strong>not Word documents</strong>, and do not give me any hard copies unless you have a very good reason.<sup id="fnref:fyi"><a href="#fn:fyi" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Your research papers will be processed by the plagiarism detector Turn It In. If your group does not want to use Turn It In, you can choose to discuss your work with me in person during my office hours.</p>

<h1 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h1>

<p>I will take off 5% a day for every day, or part of a day, that your research paper is late, including weekends.</p>

<h1 id="required-readings">Required Readings</h1>

<p>You do not have to buy any books for this course. I have chosen excerpts of books that I can provide electronically under the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-guidelines/fair-dealing-advisory">fair dealing provision in the copyright act</a>.<sup id="fnref:yes"><a href="#fn:yes" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>You should download three books that are available online for free under Creative Commons licenses: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Lawrence Lessig’s <a href="http://codev2.cc"><em>Code: Version 2.0</em></a></li>
  <li>Gabriella Coleman’s <a href="http://codingfreedom.com/buy_download.html"><em>Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking</em></a></li>
  <li>Christopher Kelty’s <a href="http://twobits.net/pub/Kelty-TwoBits.pdf"><em>Two Bits: The Cultural Significance of Free Software</em></a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other required readings will be available on LEARN, or through the University of Waterloo library system.</p>

<p>Although not required, I highly recommend getting copies of Janet Abbate’s <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Inventing-Internet-Janet-Abbate/dp/0262511150/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411309991&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=inventing+the+internet"><em>Inventing the Internet</em></a>, Heather Douglas’ <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Science-Policy-Value-Free-Heather-Douglas/dp/0822960265"><em>Science, Policy, and the Value Free Ideal</em></a>, and Rainee and Wellman’s <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Networked-The-Social-Operating-System/dp/0262017199"><em>Networked: The New Social Operating System</em></a>.</p>

<p>I am hoping that this course sparks your interest in social network analysis more broadly. If you want to pick up a book on the field, I have plenty of suggestions. </p>

<!-- \citet{christakis2009connected} and \citet{watts2004six} have written good general audience books. \citet{freeman04:_devel_of_social_networ_analy} documented the history of the field, and \citet{scott2011sage} provides an excellent overview of the field. \citet{prell2011social} and \citet{Scott:2013aa} are excellent introductions and resources for researchers, and Kaduschin focuses on theory. \citet{wasserman94} is a classic, but may be a little too technical if you are new to the field.  -->

<h1 id="access-ability-services">Access Ability Services</h1>

<p>The  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/disability-services/">AccessAbility Office</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with the AccessAbility Office at the beginning of each academic term.  </p>

<h1 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h1>

<p>The University of Waterloo, the Faculty of Environment, and our Departments consider students’ well-being to be extremely important. We recognize that throughout the term students may face health challenges — physical and / or emotional.  Please note that help is available. Mental health is a serious issue for everyone and can affect your ability to do your best work. Counselling Services<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">8</a></sup> is an inclusive, non-judgmental, and confidential space for anyone to seek support. They offer confidential counselling for a variety of areas including anxiety, stress management, depression, grief, substance use, sexuality, relationship issues, and much more. </p>

<h1 id="university-policies">University Policies</h1>

<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>We will all uphold academic integrity policies at University of Waterloo, which include but are not limited to  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/about-academic-integrity/integrity-policies-0">promoting academic freedom and a community free from discrimination and harassment</a>. You can educate yourself on these policies — and the disciplinary processes in place to deal with violations — on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/integrity-waterloo-students">Office of Academic Integrity website</a>.</p>

<p>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offense, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offense, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work / collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor, academic advisor, or the Undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student Discipline.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">10</a></sup> For typical penalties, check Guidelines for Assessment of Penalties.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">11</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="grievances-and-appeals">Grievances and Appeals</h2>

<p>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of his / her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy 70 — Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">12</a></sup> When in doubt please contact your Undergraduate Advisor for details.</p>

<p>A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70 — Student Petitions and Grievances (other than a petition) or Policy 71 — (Student Discipline) may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to Policy 72 (Student Appeals).<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="religious-observances">Religious Observances</h2>

<p>Student needs to inform the instructor <strong>at the beginning of term</strong> if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and assignments. </p>

<h1 id="feedback">Feedback</h1>

<p>I will use LEARN’s Survey tool to solicit brief and informal course evaluations three or four times throughout the semester. These are <em>anonymous</em>, and will only take a few minutes of your time. The purpose is to make sure that we are moving at a comfortable pace, that you feel you understand the material, and that my teaching style is meeting your needs. I will use this ongoing feedback to make adjustments as the course progresses. Although you are not obligated to do so, please fill out the evaluations so that I can make this the best learning experience for you, and the best teaching experience for me.</p>

<h1 id="class-format">Class Format</h1>

<p>This course emphasizes collaborative learning. Group discussions will usually take place at the beginning of the class, followed by any lecture material at the end. When I lecture, it will mostly be to explain difficult concepts, or aspects of the readings that are not addressed in group discussion. </p>

<h1 id="class-schedule-and-assigned-readings">Class Schedule and Assigned Readings</h1>

<p><em>We may adjust the reading schedule throughout the semester. All changes will be announced in class and via the course website on LEARN.</em> I have included some recommended readings in case you are looking to learn more. They are <strong>not</strong> required reading.</p>
